    install mysql WITHOUT ncurses configuration? Not sure how to do this one.

  Required

    - If the script fails, it should be able to be re-run without breaking anything. Currently, It will fail on symlinking and mkdir. Probably other things.

    - configure nginx to serve images from '/images', 'wp-content/themes/*' and 

    - set the hostname, based on the basename of the first url
